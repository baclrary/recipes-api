I've devoted countless hours to exploring every corner of \"The Witcher 3.\" Recently, in a shared adventure that began in December of 2023, I introduced my girlfriend to this captivating world. It was her first foray into the game, and together, we embarked on a journey unlike any other \u2014 she at the helm, with me by her side, offering guidance and support. She immersed herself in the game with passion, dedicating her vacation to uncovering its secrets. Together, we navigated nearly every quest, save for a few elusive ones like \"The Cave of Dreams\" and those tied to Gwent. Over two months, she completed the game and its DLCs, investing over 200 hours into a world that captivated her as much as it did me.</p> <p>Our experience was an emotional odyssey, filled with moments of joy, sadness, confusion, and empathy \u2014 a testament to the game's power to evoke a spectrum of feelings. A few years before, she had also delved into the books, which enriched our connection to the narrative even more. The culmination of our journey, particularly the poignant conclusion of the \"Blood and Wine\" DLC, where Geralt smiles knowingly at us, left a lasting impression. It felt like a farewell to a friend, a hero who had earned his peace in the serene Corvo Bianco, with the promise of visits from cherished companions.</p> <p>This journey through \"The Witcher 3\" was more than just a game; it was a journey that brought us closer, filled with emotions. I feel driven to contribute to this magnificent world that has given us so much joy and so many memories.</p>"},{"location":"installation/","title":"Installation","text":"<p>The project relies on various dependencies that must be installed.</p>"},{"location":"installation/#quick-start","title":"Quick start","text":"<ol> <li><code>poetry shell</code> - Activate an environment.</li> <li><code>poetry install</code> - Install the dependencies.</li> <li><code>docker compose build</code> - Build the project.</li> <li><code>docker compose up</code> - Start the services.</li> <li><code>docker compose run --rm app sh -c \"python manage.py test\"</code> - Run tests.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"installation/#project-layout","title":"Project layout","text":"<pre><code>\u251c\u2500\u2500 Dockerfile\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 app/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 app     # Django Settings\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 core    # Core package; contains shared code and commands\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs    # The documentation\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 items/  # App represents items from the game\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __pycache__\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 admins\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 apps.py\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 filters\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 interfaces\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 migrations\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 models\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 serializers\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 tests\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 urls.py\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 views\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 manage.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 media       # Directory contains assets &amp; user's uploads\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml  # Docs settings\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 templates   # Rewritten templates for django admin\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 users       # App handles API's users\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docker-compose.yml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 poetry.lock\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 pyproject.toml  # Dependencies\n</code></pre>"}]}
